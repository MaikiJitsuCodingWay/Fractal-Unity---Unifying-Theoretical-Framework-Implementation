# Fractal-Unity---Unifying-Theoretical-Framework-Implementation
Welcome to the Fractal Unity repository, where we aim to implement a unifying theoretical framework that leverages fractal technology to bridge diverse domains. This project seeks to develop software that visualizes and tests our unified theories, bringing them to life through interactive front-end and back-end solutions.
